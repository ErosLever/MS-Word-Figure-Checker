# MS-Word-Figure-Checker
This tool was developed with the idea of checking whether all numbered Figures and their references are correct in a Microsoft Word document.

Features:
- Detects the Figure keyword (e.g., "Figure" in English, "Figura" in Italian) and warns if more than one keyword is used.
- Warns you about Figures not referenced in the text.
- Warns about Figures with the wrong number.
- If autofix is enabled, tries to correct Figures with the wrong number.
- Warns about references to Figures with the wrong number.
- If autofix is enabled, tries to correct references to Figures with the wrong number.
- Warns you if other references to images are found in plain text.
